Chrome Extension Modifier
-------------------------
Written by Guy Sheffer <guysoft at gmail.com>

A cross-platform Google Chrome/Chromium extension Modifier, 
as a workaround issue: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=77440

Currently modifies TweetDeck to have right-to-left support.
Built modularly to provide a toolkit to modify any Chrome extension

Tested on Linux and Windows 

Requirements
------------
Python >= 2.7
wxPython 2.8

On Debian/Ubuntu:
apt-get python-wxgtk2.8

On Windows you would have to download python and wxpython from their websites

Running on Linux
----------------
python src/Main.py

Running on Windows
------------------
Download and run TweetDeckRTLPatcher.exe

From: http://bit.ly/TweetDeckRTLPatch

GUI editing
-----------
The gui is built with wxglade, you can edit it graphically by opening:
wxglade ChromeExtensionModifier.wxg

Packaging on Windows
--------------------
You can build an executable with pyinstaller:  http://www.pyinstaller.org/
(Note you will need pywin32 for pyinstaller: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)
The binary unfortunately is huge, no idea how to reduce its size
